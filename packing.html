				<h2>Cultural Etiquette</h2>
				<p>
					Malaysia is a culturally rich country with a blend of Malay, Chinese,
					Indian, and indigenous influences. To show respect for local customs
					and traditions, consider the following tips:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Dress modestly when visiting religious sites. Cover your shoulders
						and knees, and remove your shoes before entering temples and
						mosques.
					</li>
					<li>
						Learn a few basic phrases in Malay, the official language, such as
						greetings and common pleasantries. Locals appreciate the effort,
						even if you primarily communicate in English.
					</li>
					<li>
						Remove your shoes when entering someone's home or a place of
						worship.
					</li>
					<li>Public displays of affection are generally discouraged.</li>
					<li>
						It's customary to give and receive with your right hand, as the left
						hand is considered unclean.
					</li>
					<li>
						Malaysians are known for their warmth and hospitality. Be polite and
						friendly when interacting with locals, and you'll likely receive a
						warm welcome in return.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Packing List</h2>
				<p>
					Malaysia's climate is typically warm and humid throughout the year, so
					pack lightweight and breathable clothing. Don't forget to include
					essentials such as sunscreen, insect repellent, a wide-brimmed hat,
					and sunglasses to protect yourself from the tropical sun. If you plan
					to explore the rainforests, consider packing a light rain jacket and
					sturdy, comfortable walking shoes. Malaysia's diverse culture means
					you may be visiting religious sites, so remember to bring modest
					clothing to respect local customs. <br /><br />

					For electronics, Malaysia uses the Type G plug with a standard voltage
					of 230V and a frequency of 50Hz. Bring necessary adapters and chargers
					for your devices. <br /><br />

					If you have prescription medications, carry an adequate supply and a
					copy of your prescription. Over-the-counter medications for common
					ailments can be purchased locally. <br /><br />

					Lastly, make copies of essential documents, including your passport,
					visa, travel insurance, and itinerary. Store them separately from the
					originals. <br /><br />
				</p>
				<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
				<p>
					With its captivating culture, lush landscapes, and mouthwatering
					cuisine, Malaysia promises a travel experience filled with adventure
					and discovery. By preparing in advance, respecting local customs, and
					staying health-conscious, you'll be well-equipped to make the most of
					your trip to this remarkable Southeast Asian destination. Safe
					travels!
